# 🛠️ Practical Coping Strategies for Neurodivergent Developers

## 🧠 ADHD Strategies

### Focus Management
- **Pomodoro Technique** - 25 min work, 5 min break
- **Body doubling** - Work alongside others (in person or virtual)
- **Time blocking** - Schedule specific tasks in calendar
- **Two-minute rule** - If it takes <2 min, do it now
- **"Eat the frog"** - Hardest task first thing

### Tools That Help
- Noise-cancelling headphones
- Website blockers (Cold Turkey, Freedom)
- Task managers with notifications
- Visual timers
- Lo-fi music / white noise

### Common Challenges
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Starting tasks | 5-minute commitment only |
| Finishing projects | Break into tiny milestones |
| Forgetting things | External brain (notes, calendar) |
| Hyperfocus crashes | Set alarms for breaks |
| Decision fatigue | Automate routine choices |

## 📚 Dyslexia Strategies

### Reading Code
- **Syntax highlighting** - Use high-contrast themes
- **Font choice** - OpenDyslexic, Comic Sans, or sans-serif
- **Text-to-speech** - Let the computer read to you
- **Screen rulers** - Guides to track lines
- **Increased spacing** - Line height 1.5-2.0

### Writing Code
- **Voice coding** - Dictate code with Talon Voice
- **Autocomplete** - Copilot, IntelliSense
- **Linters** - Catch typos automatically
- **Pair programming** - Real-time review
- **Templates** - Reduce from-scratch writing

### Variable Naming
- Use descriptive names (less memory load)
- Keep a project glossary
- Use IDE search instead of memorizing
- Comment liberally

## ♾️ Autism Strategies

### Sensory Management
- **Lighting** - Adjust blue light, use lamps instead of overhead
- **Sound** - Headphones, white noise, quiet rooms
- **Clothing** - Comfortable, tag-free
- **Temperature** - Control your workspace temp
- **Breaks** - Step away when overstimulated

### Communication
- **Written > verbal** - Request emails for important info
- **Meeting agendas** - Know topics in advance
- **Processing time** - "Let me think about that"
- **Direct language** - Be clear, expect clarity
- **Video off** - Use chat or voice when cameras drain you

### Routine & Structure
- Same workspace, same time
- Predictable schedule when possible
- Rituals for starting/ending work
- Clear task definitions
- Documented processes

## 🎯 Universal Strategies

### Energy Management
```
Energy Levels Throughout Day:

High Energy → Difficult/creative work
Medium Energy → Routine coding
Low Energy → Code review, documentation
```

### Burnout Prevention
- ✅ Regular breaks (even 30 seconds helps)
- ✅ Physical movement (walk, stretch)
- ✅ Boundaries (work hours, no after-hours Slack)
- ✅ Hobbies outside tech
- ✅ Sleep hygiene

### Workspace Setup
- **Dual monitors** - Less mental context switching
- **Standing desk** - Movement helps focus
- **Plants/art** - Visual interest for breaks
- **Good chair** - Physical comfort = mental focus
- **Natural light** - Or full-spectrum bulbs

## 🚨 Emergency Strategies

### When Overwhelmed
1. Stop
2. Breathe (4-7-8 technique)
3. Step away from screen
4. Drink water
5. Quick walk
6. Return when regulated

### When Stuck
1. Rubber duck debugging (explain to object)
2. Draw a diagram
3. Take a break
4. Ask for help (Discord, Stack Overflow)
5. Work on something else
6. Sleep on it

### When Executive Function Fails
- **Can't start?** → Just open the file
- **Can't decide?** → Flip a coin
- **Can't focus?** → Change location
- **Can't stop?** → Set alarm, stand up
- **Can't remember?** → Write it down NOW

## 💊 Medication & Neurodivergence

### If You Take Meds
- Set phone reminders
- Keep water nearby
- Track effectiveness
- Communicate with doctor
- Don't skip doses (if daily)

### If You Don't
- That's valid too!
- Many succeed without meds
- Accommodations are equally important
- Tools and strategies work

## 📱 Apps Specifically Helpful

### ADHD
- Forest (focus timer)
- Habitica (gamified tasks)
- Brain Focus Productivity Timer
- Focus@Will (music for ADHD)

### Dyslexia
- Voice Dream Reader
- Ghotit (spell checker)
- ClaroRead
- Read&Write

### Autism
- Calm (meditation)
- Daylio (mood tracking)
- Routinery (routine building)
- Smiling Mind (mindfulness)

## 🎓 Learning & Skill Development

### Study Techniques
- **Active recall** - Test yourself
- **Spaced repetition** - Anki for concepts
- **Visual learning** - Diagrams, videos
- **Hands-on** - Build projects immediately
- **Teach others** - Solidifies knowledge

### Documentation
- **Screenshots** - Visual references
- **Code comments** - Explain why, not what
- **Personal wiki** - Obsidian, Notion
- **Voice notes** - Quick capture

## 🤝 Working with Others

### Asking for Accommodations
- Be direct about needs
- Frame as performance optimization
- Suggest specific solutions
- Know your rights (ADA in US)

### Examples
- "I focus best with headphones"
- "Can we have written meeting notes?"
- "I need 24hr notice for schedule changes"
- "I work best during [hours]"

## 🌟 Self-Care Reminders

- 💧 Drink water (seriously)
- 🍎 Eat regular meals
- 😴 Sleep matters (even if ADHD makes it hard)
- 🚶 Move your body
- 🎮 Take breaks
- 🗣️ Talk to someone
- 💊 Take meds if prescribed
- 🎨 Do something fun
