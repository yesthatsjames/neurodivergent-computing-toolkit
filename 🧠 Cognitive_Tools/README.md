# 🧠 Cognitive Tools

Practical tools for reducing cognitive friction in the terminal.
Built for dyslexia, ADHD, and neurodivergent brains generally.

Not workarounds. Optimisations.

## What's Here

### [focus-mode.sh](focus-mode.sh) + [focus-mode.md](focus-mode.md)
A shell tool that creates a clean, distraction-free terminal session.
Name your one task. Clear the noise. Track your time.
For when you need to stop losing the thread.

### [dyslexia-vim-config.md](dyslexia-vim-config.md)
Vim and Neovim configuration for dyslexic users.
Spell check, cursor tracking, readable line spacing, auto-save,
plain-language navigation tips, and font recommendations.

### [neurodivergent-git-aliases.md](neurodivergent-git-aliases.md)
Git aliases in plain language.
`git oops` instead of `git reset HEAD~1 --soft`.
`git what` instead of `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`.
Includes a one-command setup script.

## The Philosophy

These tools are built on one principle:

**You should be thinking about your work, not the syntax of your tools.**

Every piece of cognitive load the tool imposes is cognitive load
that isn't going into the thing you're actually making.

For neurodivergent brains that are already managing extra load —
tracking words on a page, holding context in working memory,
filtering out environmental noise — this matters more, not less.
