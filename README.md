# Neurodivergent Computing Toolkit

**Author:** James (@yesthatsjames)
**Built from:** Lived experience as neurodivergent technologist
**Purpose:** Tools and accommodations that work with different cognitive styles

## 🧠 Philosophy

These aren't "workarounds" - they're optimizations for neurodivergent cognition that benefit EVERYONE.

**Neurotypical systems assume:**
- Linear time management
- Text-heavy interfaces
- Sustained attention to boring tasks

**Neurodivergent systems optimize for:**
- Visual-spatial thinking
- Hyperfocus/recovery cycles
- Executive function support

## 🎨 What's Included

### Visual Organization
- Emoji folder structure (visual anchors)
- Color-coded hierarchy
- Spatial memory optimization

### Context Management
- Hyperfocus recovery scripts
- Project context saving
- "Where was I?" prevention

### Executive Function Support
- Bash aliases (reduce decision fatigue)
- Automation for maintenance tasks
- Low-friction workflows

## 🚀 Resources

- 💼 **Workplace Accommodations** - Templates and strategies
- 🎨 **Coping Strategies** - Practical frameworks
- 🦸 **Neurodivergent Strengths** - Reframing "disabilities" as capabilities
- 📖 **Resources** - Curated learning materials

## 🔮 Future

**Prediction (2025):** By 2027-2028, neurodivergent-first design becomes accessibility standard. This work is 3+ years ahead.
